hi,
this is our project SBA 308A. JavaScript Web Application
Our main goal in this project is to query data from an API and manipilate the fetched data. to do so, we have fetched the cat api and created a web site the allow the user to make a vote based on random images received from the api. the final vote is displayed as a gallery at the end of the vote.
some methodes used in our proect are :
* fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your applicationâ€™s content and features.
* Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.
* Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate.
and so one. thank you for reading and see you in the actual project.
